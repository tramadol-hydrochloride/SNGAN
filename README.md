# GANs with spectral normalization and projection discriminator
Modified [Preferred Networks' implementation of SNGAN with projection](https://github.com/pfnet-research/sngan_projection) to work with the original dataset.

## The notable changes are:
* add config files, image processing script, other misc files for working the original dataset.

* modify and add the scripts for custom evaluation (image generation) (ie. evatuation.py, evaluations/{}.py)

# Examples
to be come
